-- copy/paste of the remote API definition with the following changes::
--  - 'type' -> 'data'
--  - 'âˆ€ a' removed
--  - invalid characters removed (CPU%, spawn-sandboxed -> spawn_sandboxed etc)
--  - commented out keywords node/ephemeral/durable/foreign
--  - reordering to put data declarations before their uses
